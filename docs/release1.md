# Release 1

For the first release we have setup the project in gitlab and configured the file structure with AppControllers for every fxml file: games.fxml, padel.fxml and scoreBoard.fxml. For the first release, only registerng players and saving the player list to a file #6 is implemented. 

The readme files for both the project #5 and app description #4 have been completed. In addition, we have created user stories #1 and a simple test for the application #7.

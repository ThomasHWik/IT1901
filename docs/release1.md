# Release 1

For the first release we have setup the project in gitlab and configured the file structure with AppControllers for every fxml file: games.fxml, padel.fxml and scoreBoard.fxml. For the first release, only registerng players and saving the player list to a file #6 is implemented. 

The readme files for both the project #5 and app description #4 have been completed. In addition, we have created user stories #1 and a simple test for the application #7.

## Group work
The group work has consisted of group meetings as well as individual work. Every group member has been assigned issues to resolve and done so. In addition, the group has met with the teaching assistant for help regarding questions we had about the first deliverable (release 1), and we have used Piazza to ask further questions.

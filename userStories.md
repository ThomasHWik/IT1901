## Organizing a tournament for a friend group

As a private person in a friend group of padel enthusiasts, I want an easy way to set up a friend tournament.

There is a need to register participants, assign courts, and create a simple overview of who is playing against whom at what time. In addition, the results must be logged and the tournament has to end with one winner.

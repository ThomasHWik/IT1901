# App description

The app should allow users to register as a player, and based on the players, the app should assign courts and pairs of players such that every player has a court and someone to play with. In addition, the app should include functionality for creation and tracking of tournaments and game results.

## Game assigment
Players will either play singles matches vs another player, or will be grouped with another player and play doubles against another team on an assigned court.
The players will only play against the player or team first paired up with.

## Game results
Players register the game results (games won and games lost) for a pairing, and based on the results, the app should provide a scoreboard. The scoreboard is made based on phonenumber, so if someone has the same name they will still be separated on the scoreboard.

## Tournament
In later versions users should be able to create torunaments of the participating players, where players or teams play against multiple opponents.
